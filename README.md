# Fluid Simulation based on Navier-Stokes Equations
This is a project I made for the course *DH2323 Computer Graphics and Interaction* at *KTH Royal Institute of Technology*. In the project I made a simple fluid dynamics simulator based on the Navier-Stokes Equations and a paper by Jos Stam, but extended to include support for static objects the fluid can interact with. This program can give a realistic looking simulation of fluids in real-time that could be used to demonstrate fluid movement where precise accuracy is not the main point, but where instead the visual quality is of higher importance.

The paper by Stam can be [found here](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/public_user/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf) or [here from another host](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Spring11/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf).
Another paper of great help that I also found handy written by Mike Ash, can be found at [his website](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html).

During the development of the project I wrote a development blog which can be found in the [blog.md](blog.md) file.
